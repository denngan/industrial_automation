## Chapter 1


### Keywords

* plants: continuous vs discrete
* processes: continuous vs batch
* control: open loop vs closed loop

### Exam Questions

1. **What are the two principal kinds of plants, the way of modeling them and of controlling them?**

> **terms:** plant, control
>
> discrete vs continuous plants
> *discrete:* states well defined, non-overlapping; abrupt transitions caused by events. (binary variables - on/off) mainly reversible but not monotone (removing stimulus does not imply previous state)
>   model: Finite State Machines, Petri Nets, State Transition Tables, Sequential Flow charts etc.
>   control task: command (control state transitions)
>
> *continuous:* states described by continuous (analog) variables (temperature, voltage, speed); reversible: output can be brought back to previous value by ackting on input; monotone: increasing input causes output to react monotonous.
>   model: continuous function F(p)
>   control task: regulation (maintain state on a determined level or trajectory)

2. **What are the principal categories of processes? Give examples.**



3. **To which category do the following applications belong: production of cement, chocolate packaging, traffic lights of crossroads, waste water, bottle-filling, power plant, pulp&paper and which effect does the plant have on the operation of the automation system?**
